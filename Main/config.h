// The logic with invoiceKey, staticLNURLp and walletID is as follows:
// - invoiceKey is mandatory (otherwise we can't check balance or payments)
// - staticLNURLp is recommended because then no need to fetch it so it's faster
// - walletID is recommended because it's need for the websocket, which then allows for instant incoming payments
// How this is handled in code:
// if the user hasn't provided a staticLNURLp then lnurlp and walletID are fetched using lnurlp/api/v1/links
// if the user has provided a staticLNURLp then that one is used and:
//    - if the user also provided a wallet ID then that one is used (no need to fetch it)
//    - if the user hasn't provided a wallet ID:
//        - the wallet ID is taken from incoming payments, if any are found
//        - if there are no incoming payments, then the wallet ID is fetched using lnurlp/api/v1/links
